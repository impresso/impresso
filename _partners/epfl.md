[dhlab.epfl.ch](https://dhlab.epfl.ch/) &mdash; Founded in 2012, the Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLAB) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne develops computational approaches applied to humanities.
Research at the DHLAB is highly interdisciplinary and explores a variety of fields including linguistics, literature, history, art history and architecture, with the support of methods from computer science, computer vision, NLP, geographic information processing, photogrammetry and web development. The DHLAB develops methods and software for the transcription and annotation of historical documents, the extraction of information from historical texts and the reconstruction and visualisation of geographical spaces in 2 and 3D.

**Role**: The DHLAB is responsible for overall management (WP1), system design and data management (WP2), named entity processing (WP3.4) and annotation and benchmarking (WP4), and will contribute to other work packages in close collaboration with all partners.

**Participants**: Frédéric Kaplan (PI), Maud Ehrmann, Matteo Romanello (from 01/2018 on).
