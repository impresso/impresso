The *impresso* consortium met for the first time in Lausanne, on the 24-25th of October for the kick-off meeting.

All the *impresso* partners gathered to share their expectations and propose their contributions. The workshop started with the presentation of partners, followed by a round table with the content providers, namely the main cultural institutions from Switzerland and Luxembourg: the National Library of Luxembourg, the National Library of Switzerland, the State Archives of Valais, the *Médiathèque du Valais* and the representatives from the two main Swiss newspapers, Le Temps and the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, NZZ.

The discussion was enriched by a special guest from the Berlin State Library: Clemens Neudecker, who shared his experience with the *Europeana newspapers project* (2012-2015). He gave insights into the practical experience from this project, on the pre-processing, the issue of size of the files constituting the corpus, the diversity of the collections in format and quality. This feedback proved to be very useful for impresso, as many of the challenges that the Europeana newspaper project faced are still ahead of us.

In the spirit of co-design that fuels the conception and the practical organisation of impresso, the workshop enabled a intensive and fruitful dialogue between these cultural institutions and the interdisciplinary team of impresso as well with specialists of media history and digital history from the Universities of Lausanne (UNIL). Each group of stakeholders presented its expectations and contributions to the project, before all gathered around a discussion on research scenarios. The institutions  shared their practice of digitisation and strategies for making their collection available to the public and the scientific communities. The expected outcomes for them are mainly a better understanding of the use of these digitised newspaper collections and an enriched collection, with annotations or better OCR quality.

The researchers shared their practice of using historical newspapers in research and in teaching. The dominant concern was the representativity of the available corpus and the need for transparency on the searchability of the corpus, accessible via the projected impresso interface. Transparency will also be needed for the tools applied to that corpus: users need to have an understanding of how a search is conducted to allow them to assess the value of their search results. Finally, the impresso team presented state of the art research tools ranging from data visualisation techniques to topic modelling that were submitted to discussion for the co-design conception of the interface.

After the roundtables provided the participants with a better understanding of each other’s needs and the tool presentation with food for thoughts on the technical possibilities, the participants were split in smaller groups to discuss some practical research scenarios. Thereupon a very lively discussion on concrete application of the planned interface and the NLP tools took place and supplied the impresso team with detailed feedback on specific research use cases. 

The main finding we retrieved from this workshop is the demand for transparency of the corpus: how can we ensure that users understand the corpus they work on, what they can expect to find and what not as well as gaps in the coverage of newspapers. Transparency is a challenge brought by the formidable possibilities of the digitized and hence searchable newspapers.

The other significant added value of the digitized newspapers is the possibility for connectivity and reframing the browsing of newspapers collections. If the corpus is more easily searchable, via person, topics or events, it becomes also more easily connected to other sources of knowledge and more flexible in its exploration. How can a query be contextualised? How can recommendations trigger further insights on a particular topic? How can a browsable overview of the corpus be designed to enable the exploration and immersion in a corpus? These are some of the substantial needs expressed during the workshop that will fuel our co-design discussion for the coming years. 
Accordingly, the designed interface and the tools exploring it need to show “what is” but also provide opportunities to browse the corpus on different levels for a more diverse access to this corpus, in addition to an efficient search capacity. In other words, the interface should be conceived in a more “generous” mindset, to broaden the current research practices and harvest the range of advantages the digitisation of historical materials offer.

The discussion on the scenarios will help us to formulate more precise user scenarios, on which we will base our first prototypes, planned for July 2018. Before that milestone, we plan on meeting again with our partners in research, for a more informed discussion on the conception of the research tools and their relevance for their scientific and teaching activities, beginning of next year.

 We thank all the participants for their input and their energy!
