<p>The objective of the project "Media monitoring of the past. Mining 200 years of historical newspapers" is to enable <strong>critical text mining of newspaper archives</strong> with the implementation of a technological framework to extract, process, link, and explore data from print media archives. Supported by an <a href="https://impresso-project.ch/consortium">interdisciplinary consortium</a> composed of computational linguists, digital humanists, designers, historians, librarians and archivists, <em>impresso</em> (i.e. &ldquo;what has been printed&rdquo;) tackled the challenges of <strong>content enrichment</strong> and <strong>data representation, visualization and analysis</strong>, completed by <strong>methodological and epistemological reflections</strong>. Our outcomes include, among others, a set of natural language processing (NLP) tools and data dedicated to historical print media, a user interface for active exploration and critical analysis of newspaper corpora and accompanying didactic materials.</p>

    <p> <b>Time frame</b>: September 2017 - December 2020 </p>

<!--<p>Historical newspapers represent a wealth of archival material which offer a daily account of the past. If newspaper archives are currently undergoing mass digitization, much remains to be done in order to provide an extensive and sophisticated access to the information they contain. The aim of the project "Media monitoring of the past. Mining 200 years of historical newspapers" is to critical text mining of newspaper archives with the implementation of a technological framework to extract, process, link, and explore data from media archives. Supported by an interdisciplinary consortium featuring researchers from computer sciences and humanities, it will tackle the challenges of content enrichment, data representation, visualization and analysis, completed by methodological and epistemological reflections.</p>-->

<!--<p>For long held on library and archive shelving, newspapers are currently undergoing mass digitization, and millions of facsimiles, along with their machine-readable content acquired via Optical Character Recognition, are becoming accessible via a variety of online portals. If this represents a major step forward in terms of preservation of and access to documents, much remains to be done in order to provide an extensive and sophisticated access to the content of these digital resources.-->
