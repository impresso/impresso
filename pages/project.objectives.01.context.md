The following objectives served to guide the project between 2017 and 2020.

Historical newspapers are mirrors of past societies. Published over centuries on a regular basis, they record wars and minor events, report on international, national and local matters, and document day-to-day life. In a nutshell, they keep track of history at every level, and the wealth of information they offer as well as their inherent contextualisation makes them invaluable primary sources for historians.

After long remaining on library and archive shelves, newspapers are now undergoing mass digitisation, and millions of facsimiles, along with their machine-readable content acquired via Optical Character Recognition, are becoming accessible via a variety of online portals. While this represents a major step forward in terms of preservation of and access to documents, conducting research using these sources raises a number of problems, including a lack of text searchability as a result of poor text recognition and missing metadata, the relative isolation of digitised newspapers within their respective archives, search functions that are difficult to use, and poorly designed user interfaces.

However, recent progress in text analysis has also opened up new possibilities for conducting research on historical text collections. Opportunities include enhanced analysis capacities, with the possibility of automatically exploring the content of newspapers with an unprecedented combination of speed, depth and volume; a wider scope, with the ability to conduct comprehensive studies by comparing and contrasting viewpoints; and greater continuity, with the option of considering the entire lifespan of newspapers or collections of newspapers in a single study. This project explored the possibilities raised by these new techniques.
