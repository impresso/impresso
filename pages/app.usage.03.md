## Impresso challenges - how to become an impresso power user

Based on concrete examples, the _impresso_ challenges offer a step-by-step and hands-on guidance through the application. The first challenge introduces the interface features, to make the most of the search tools offered by the application: how to read the frequency lines, how to use topics and named entities as filters, and how to explore the _impresso_ corpus. The second challenge introduces some digital source criticism elements to help you understand the limits inherent to such a digital corpus and its automatically extracted information. Finally, the third challenge proposes to explore the _impresso_ corpus with a more abstract perspective, to illustrate the operationalisation of research questions via the interface features.

## FAQs about Natural Language Processing and impresso application components

FAQs offers a wealth of documentation on each feature and is accessible via the info buttons distributed across the interface, and on the FAQ page. They provide short explanations of the interface features and the underlying processes, as well as explanations on the copyright status of the _impresso_ materials (images, OCR text, semantic annotations).
