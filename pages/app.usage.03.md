## Impresso challenges - how to become an impresso power user

Based on concrete examples, the impresso challenges offer a step-by-step and hands-on guidance through the application. The first challenge introduces the interface features, to make the most of the search tools offered by the application: how to read the frequency lines, how to use topics and named entities as filters and explore the collection. The second challenge introduces some digital source criticism elements, to help you spot the limits inherent to the automatically extracted information. Finally, the third challenge proposes to explore the impresso collection with a more abstract perspective, to underline the operationalisation of research questions via the interface features.

## FAQs about Natural Language Processing and impresso application components

FAQs offers a wealth of documentation on each feature and is accessible via the info buttons distributed across the interface, and on the FAQ page. They provide short explanations of the interface features and the underlying processes, as well as explanations on the copyright status of the _impresso_ materials (images, OCR text, semantic annotations).
