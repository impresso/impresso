*impresso* provides access to a vast corpus of digitised newspapers enhanced with digital tools and covering several countries of origin. It is vital to engage in a process of methodological comparison of these sources presented in a new format. Source criticism is essential for historiographical reflection and has driven many debates on the digitisation of historical sources.

Within the *impresso* project, this process of reflection covers familiar ground in terms of digital source criticism and media history criticism of newspapers as historical sources. However, digital newspaper collections also raise new questions related to the datafication and limits of historical sources. For example, handling an incomplete source collection is a standard skill, but encountering imperfect data sets can raise distrust in the system as a whole. Issues related to digital bias are therefore investigated by historians together with designers, computational linguists and digital humanists within *impresso*.

These discussions should result in the exposure of digital bias, including digital blind spots (“shadows”) such as the lack of visibility of material that is not made available online. The interface was also designed to bridge the gap of lost context that is inherent in newspaper digitisation, thereby avoiding the loss of precious information for historians.

Digitised material potentially changes the relationship between historians and their sources: instead of addressing their research questions to a specific corpus (for example a specific newspaper), historians can now investigate a broader corpus that is not predefined, paving the way for potential new findings. Digitisation offers access to a larger collection of searchable newspapers which extends from the transnational to the national and local scale, opening up new corpora and providing a broader scope of material which ranges from the satirical to the political and encompasses specialist (e.g. women’s) newspapers as well as more general newspapers. Digitised collections have the potential to redefine the practice of historical research, opening up the possibility of searching in an externally defined corpus. We can focus our attention on the wording of the research question and apply it to several collections.

The basis of the development process for the research tools in *impresso*, especially the interface, is the co-design method. Historians contributed by providing regular input on their needs and requirements to assist with the development of the research tools and interface.
